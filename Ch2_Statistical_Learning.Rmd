```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = F,

```

## 2.1 What Is Statistical Learning? 

$$
Y = f(X) + \epsilon
$$

### 2.1.1 Why Estimate f?

For prediction and inference. 

$$
\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\text{E}(Y - \hat{Y}) &= E[f(x) + \epsilon - \hat{f}(X)]^2 \\
&=[f(X) - \hat{f}(X0)]^2 + \text{Var}(\epsilon)
\end{align}
$$
